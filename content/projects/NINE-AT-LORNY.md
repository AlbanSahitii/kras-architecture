      The design emphasizes natural light, privacy, and spatial efficiency. Each
      apartment includes open-plan living, large windows, and private balconies
      that extend the interior experience outdoors. A soft, neutral material
      palette enhances the building’s calm and con-  temporary aesthetic.
